Test description

Test IDMIP4SLT2.5_2417Test TitleValidityTimePeriod NIL in a Valid Abstract ElementExecution PriorityHP (3 originally)ObjectiveCheck Optionality of Elements (specifically attributes that were mandatory within MIP3.1 and are optional within MIP4-IES Schema Documentation).
Confirm systems correctly accommodate 'NIL' values for valid abstract elements.ScenarioSend an object containing an Abstract Element with all its mandatory as well as optional elements filled in with valid values to the Gateway through the Test Tool (TT). The Abstract Element should have a ValidityTimePeriod field which is not NIL.
The restrictions for the elements' values are specified within the MIP4-IES Schema Documentation. 
Send the object again with ValidityTimePeriod set to NIL. 
The Gateway must be able to handle the NIL values for ValidityTimePeriod in the Abstract Element, by correctly mapping to the C2 system, translating NIL values to comment or any other means desired. Regardless of the method chosen to handle the NIL value, the Gateway must remain stable.EnvironmentCo-located, Internet through VPN.Participation1MTRSPre-test ConditionsThe nation's Gateway and the TT are ready to connect and have a physical connection with each other. Also the SOAP connection is established and ready for transport. 
MIP4SLT2.5_2417-n.xml data are available at the TT to be sent.Test InputsMIP4SLT2.5_2417-1.xml (all elements), MIP4SLT2.5_2417-2.xml (NIL value for ValidityTimePeriod Element in a Valid  Abstract Element).
In order to generate these XML files, special attention must be paid to attributes that were mandatory within MIP3.1 (they can be checked within MIG-Annex-F-MOR-List-v3.1.13), whose corresponding MIP4-IES Elements are now optional.
The nation should send at least one object through its test tool which has a valid abstract element with a ValidityTimePeriod value is set to NIL.ConclusionThis test is considered a success if and only if the Gateway remains stable and handles all messages correctly. Preferably, the object is displayed at the nation's C2 system with correct mandatory information.Test OutputsPass or fail.TraceabilityREQ_IDT_0004
