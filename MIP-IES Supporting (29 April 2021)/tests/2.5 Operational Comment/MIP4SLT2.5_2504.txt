Test IDMIP4SLT2.5_2504Test TitleAction comment 2500 charExecution Priority1ObjectiveVerifies the ability to create, update and exchange an operational comment (CommentText) for an Action in a nation's C2IS.ScenarioSend an Action > Task with an operational comment to the Gateway through the Test Tool (TT). The Gateway receives the information and interprets it correctly. 
Update and send the comment again. The Gateway must be able to receive and interpret it correctly. 
In either way the Gateway must remain stable.EnvironmentCo-located, Internet through VPN.Participation1MTRSApplicablePre-test ConditionsThe nation's Gateway and the TT are ready to connect and have a physical connection with each other. Also the SOAP connection is established and ready for transport.Test InputsDataset_2504x.ConclusionThis test is considered a success if the Gateway remains stable and handles all messages correctly. Preferably all comments are displayed correctly.Test OutputsPass or fail.TraceabilityREQ_INF_0001

Test Procedure

StepActionExpected ResultSrcDst1. The nation loads dataset_2504a (a Task with an operational CommentText containing more than 2500 characters) into their C2 system (2) through the TT (1). ~~Comments correctly visible in the C2 system. ~~122. The nation loads dataset_2504b (StaffCommentsText additional to the previous CommentText) into their C2 system (2) through the TT (1). ~~Both, CommentText and StaffCommentsText, correctly visible in the C2 system. ~~123. The nation loads dataset_2504c (updated CommentText resulting Element is more than 2500 characters. The StaffCommentsText remains the same) into their C2 system (2) through the TT (1). ~~Both, CommentText and StaffCommentsText, correctly visible in the C2 system. ~~124. The nation loads dataset_2504d (updated StaffCommentsText) into their C2 system (2) through the TT (1). ~~Both, CommentText and StaffCommentsText, correctly visible in the C2 system. ~~125. The nation loads dataset_2504c (updated CommentText resulting Element is less than 2500 characters.
