Test description

Test IDMIP4SLT3SF_3205Test TitleProcess an anonymous (unknown and non-MIP4) payload.Execution Priority1ObjectiveThe objective of this test is to assess the ability to process anonymous payloads.ScenarioA Consumer receives a valid anonymous payload and ignores it.EnvironmentInternet or Co-located. Exchange Pattern: R/R, P/S, FileParticipation2MTRSPre-test ConditionsTest group 3.6 'Initialisation'.Test InputsValidated means to acquire information from the Producer using a MIP4 exchange pattern.ConclusionThe consumer can ignore anonymous payloads.Test OutputsThe Consumer successfully acquires content from the Producer and is able to apply it to their system without error or ignore the payload. In any case, the Consumer should remain stable.TraceabilityREQ_SYS_0012.
