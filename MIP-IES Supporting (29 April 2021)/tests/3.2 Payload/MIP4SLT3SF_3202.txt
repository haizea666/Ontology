Test description

Test IDMIP4SLT3SF_3202Test TitleProcess valid MIP4 payload making use of the attribute extension.Execution Priority1ObjectiveThe objective of this test is to assess the ability to process valid MIP4 payloads which make use of the attribute extension.ScenarioA Consumer receives a valid MIP4 payload with extensions and processes it into their system.EnvironmentInternet or Co-located. Exchange Pattern: R/R, P/S, FileParticipation2MTRSPre-test ConditionsTest group 3.6 'Initialisation'.Test InputsValidated means to acquire information from the Producer using a MIP4 exchange pattern.ConclusionThe consumer can process MIP4 content which utilises the MIP4 attribute extension.Test OutputsThe Consumer successfully acquires content from the Producer and is able to apply it to their system without error.TraceabilityREQ_SYS_0011.



Test Procedure
