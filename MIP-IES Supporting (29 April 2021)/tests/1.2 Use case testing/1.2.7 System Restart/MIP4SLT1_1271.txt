Test IDMIP4SLT1_1271Test TitleRestart - Producer (P/S)Execution Priority1ObjectiveAssess systems behaviour after Producer restart within the Publish/Subscribe exchange pattern.  ScenarioProducer is processing a subscription request from Consumer and providing update information as prescribed utilizing the Publish/Subscribe exchange mechanism.  
Producer restarts.EnvironmentInternet or Co-located. Exchange Pattern: P/S.Participation2.MTRSN/APre-test ConditionsMIP4SLT1_1231 - Current situation P/S nominal consumption established and working.Test InputsN/A.ConclusionNominal restart. Ideally, the P/S subscriptions will be re-established (although that is outside the scope of the MIP specification). 
Assess (record) how systems behave if the producer restarts.Test OutputsN/A.TraceabilityREQ_EM_0008, REQ_EM_0010
