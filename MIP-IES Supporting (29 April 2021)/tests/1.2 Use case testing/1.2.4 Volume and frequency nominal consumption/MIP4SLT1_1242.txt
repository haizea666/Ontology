Test description

Test IDMIP4SLT1_1242Test TitleHigh-frequency situationExecution Priority1ObjectiveVolumetric periodicity checking, incorporating OSG analysis, for a nominal consumption initial use case. ScenarioThe Producer (A) provides update information to the Consumer as prescribed utilising the P/S EM on a nominal consumption High-frequency situation (after OSG analysis).EnvironmentInternet or Co-located. Exchange Pattern: P/S.Participation2 or more.MTRSN/APre-test ConditionsMIP4SLT1_1231.
The Consumer has already achieved initialisation data and requested routine subscription to desired Topics.  Test InputsN/A.ConclusionThis test is considered a success if the Consumer successfully receives update information to which it is subscribed on a nominal consumption High-frequency situation.
Check volumetric behaviour on both sides, Producer and Consumer.Test OutputsN/A.TraceabilityREQ_EM_0008, REQ_EM_0010

Test Procedure

StepActionExpected ResultSrcDst1. Producer (1) processes subscription request from Consumer (2) and provides update information as prescribed utilising the Publish/Subscribe exchange mechanism, on a nominal consumption High-frequency situation (120 Position Locations / 20 min. but further clarification from OSG would be needed). ~~Consumer (2) receives updates of subscription data, on a nominal consumption High-frequency situation. 
Check and register behaviour for a periodicity volumetric analysis. ~~ 12

ItemValueCommentEventGeneration10 --> Combine steps to one event in the MTMT, generate new MTMT events on every source - destination change.
1 --> Every step will be added to the MTMT as a separate event.
