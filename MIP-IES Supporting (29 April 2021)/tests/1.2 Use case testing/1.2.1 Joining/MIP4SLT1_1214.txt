Test Procedure

StepActionExpected ResultSrcDst1. Examine the producer's service description (WSDL) to determine the operations associated with the MIP4 PortTypes (through port binding) and associated with the defined service. ~~The defined service will contain at least the following required operations for the exchange pattern:
* http://docs.oasis-open.org/wsrf/rpw-2/GetResourceProperty/GetResourcePropertyRequest
* http://mip-interop.org/wsdls/MIP4/MIPRequestResponse/GetItemsRequest (will be changed with WSMP) ~~
