Test Procedure

StepActionExpected ResultSrcDst1. Examine the producer's service description (WSDL) to determine the binding style specified for each binding relating to an MIP4 PortType. ~~The binding style is specified as 'document'. ~~122. Examine the producer's service description (WSDL) to determine the binding transport specified for each binding relating to an MIP4 PortType. ~~The binding transport is specified as 'http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/http'. ~~123. Examine the producer's service description (WSDL) to determine the operation style specified for each binding related to an MIP4 PortType. ~~The operation style is specified as 'document'.
