Test description

Test IDMIP4SLT1_1221Test TitleBase consumer initialisationExecution Priority1ObjectiveThe purpose is to verify that the consumer system being initialised is able to obtain the current situation as known by one or more systems playing the provider role.  There are two options to test: 1) The system being initialised obtains the current situation by using the MIP4.0 Request/Response Exchange Pattern (playing the Consumer role) interacting with one or more systems (playing the Provider role) capable of providing the current situation as known by them, and, 2) The system being initialised obtains the current situation by using the MIP4.0 File-Based Exchange Pattern.  Under the File-Based Exchange Pattern the current situation is received in one or more files created by one or more systems playing the Provider role.ScenarioA MIP4.0 conformant Base Consumer must implement both MIP4.0 Request-Response and File-based exchanges according to the applicable MIP4.0 Specifications.EnvironmentInternet or Co-locatedParticipationAt least 3MTRSPre-test ConditionsMIP4SLT1_1211,  MIP4SLT1_1212, MIP4SLT1_1213,  MIP4SLT1_1214, MIP4SLT1_1215  

Prior to initiating exchange of MIP4.0 messages, each participant in the exchange will complete the MIP4.0 Joining Questionnaire [REF-MIP-5] and share this questionnaire with their exchange partners.  The exchange of completed questionnaires will:
? Inform exchange partners of the capabilities of a partner system
? Allow  partners to exchange source identifiers
? Aid in the early identification of potential issues
The exchange partners are expected to resolve any identified issues prior to the actual exchange of MIP4.0 messages.

Test InputsCurrent situation as known by one or more providers.  ConclusionThe test is completed when the consumer system is able to correctly receive the current situation from multiple providers through both the MIP4.0 Request-Response and the MIP4.0 file-based protocols.Test OutputsVerification that the current situation is received correctly from multiple providers through both the Request-Response exchange pattern and the File-based exchange pattern.TraceabilityREQ_EM_0009
