Test IDMIP4SLT3IS_5222Test TitleAdd CBRNControlFeature Sub-Types.Execution Priority1ObjectiveBSO validation. Verify the ability to create and add several CBRNControlFeatures (CBRNControlFeature Sub-Types) in a nation's C2IS.ScenarioNation A creates several CBRNControlFeatures. 
Nation B receives the information and interprets it correctly.EnvironmentInternet or Co-located. Exchange Pattern: R/R, P/S.Participation2MTRSApplicablePre-test ConditionsNation A has created a Topic which includes CBRNControlFeature Sub-Types message elements, for instance Ground Picture > CBRN. 
Nation B has subscribed to this Topic.Test InputsN/A.ConclusionThis test is considered a success if the created CBRNControlFeatures are displayed correctly on both Nations' C2IS.Test OutputsN/A.TraceabilityREQ_INF_0002
