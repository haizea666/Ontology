Test IDMIP4SLT3IS_5283Test TitleUndefined GeometricDefinition for an example Control FeatureExecution Priority1ObjectiveBSO validation. Test whether the Producer/Provider is able to create and update a Control Feature with undefined GeometricDefinition and the Consumers/Receivers are able to understand (and display) it correctly.ScenarioThe Producer creates a Control Feature (AreaOfInterest) with undefined GeometricDefinition.
The Consumers receive the information and interpret it correctly.
The Producer updates this AOI with a GeometricDefinition=Polygon.
The Consumers receive the information and interpret it correctly.
The Producer updates this AOI again with an undefined GeometricDefintion. 
The Consumers receive the information and interpret it correctly.EnvironmentInternet or Co-located. Exchange Pattern: R/R, P/S.Participation2 or more.MTRSN/APre-test ConditionsThe Producer/Provider has created a topic which includes message elements belonging to the Control Feature message schema area.
The Consumers have subscribed to this topic.Test InputsN/A.ConclusionThis test is considered a success if the Control Feature is processed and interpreted correctly on all Nations' C2IS.Test OutputsN/A.TraceabilityREQ_INF_0002

Test Procedure

StepActionExpected ResultSrcDst1. The Producer (A) creates an AreaOfInterest (Control Feature) with name XXX_AOI_283 with undefined GeometricDefinition.

Notices:
XXX in name of the object is meant (in principle) to be replaced by the 3 letter code of the country name.
Example for the name of the Control Feature: ITA_AOI_283 ~~
Consumers (B) receive and display (not on the map) the AOI correctly. ~~122. The Producer (A) updates the AOI with GeometricDefinition=Polygon. ~~Consumers (B) receive and display (also on the map) the AOI correctly. ~~123. The Producer (A) updates the AOI again with an undefined GeometricDefinition. ~~Consumers (B) receive and display (again not on the map) the AOI correctly. ~~12
