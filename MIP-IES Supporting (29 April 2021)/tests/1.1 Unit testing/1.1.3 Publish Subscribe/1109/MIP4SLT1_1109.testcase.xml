  <TestCaseObjective>The objective is for the Consumer to subscribe to a topic provided by the Provider and to receive updates until a specified termination time.</TestCaseObjective>
  <TestCaseScenario>The Consumer is interested in receiving regular updates on a topic in an asynchronous way (i.e. without polling the Producer).</TestCaseScenario>

Prior to initiating exchange of MIP4.0 messages, each participant in the exchange will complete the MIP4.0 Joining Questionnaire [REF-MIP-5] and share this questionnaire with their exchange partners. The exchange of completed questionnaires will:
* Inform exchange partners of the capabilities of a partner system
* Allow  partners to exchange source identifiers
* Aid in the early identification of potential issues

The exchange partners are expected to resolve any identified issues prior to the actual exchange of MIP4.0 messages.

Exigence-1 Prior to initiating MIP4.0 Information Exchange, the exchange partners shall complete and share the MIP4.0 Joining Questionnaire.[REF-MIP-5]

Both Consumer and Producer systems conform to MIP4.0 Publish/Subscribe Exchange Pattern Specification.
Both Consumer and Producer are able to process and exchange information represented according to MIP4.0 Information Schemas.Consumer successfully discovered the target Producer. The system on the Consumer side has been properly configured and is ready to interact with the Producer system. The Producer system broadcasts at least some of the topics requested.</TestCasePreCondition>
  <TestCaseInput>N/A.</TestCaseInput>
  <TestCaseConclusion>The Consumer should receive an error message indicating that the subscription termination time is too far into the future. The test is concluded when the Consumer receives the error notification.</TestCaseConclusion>

    <TestCaseStepAction>The Consumer subscribes to the Producer in order to advertise its interest in a subset of the data space.  The consumer specifies a subscription termination time that is too far into the future.

with parameters wsn:FullTopicExpression,  wsn:FixedTopicSet, wsn:TopicExpressionDialect and wstop:TopicSet. </TestCaseStepAction>
    <TestCaseStepResult>The Producer receives a valid request for resource properties. The producer receives a subscription request with a specified termination time. The termination time is too far into the future. </TestCaseStepResult>
