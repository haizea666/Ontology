Test description

Test IDMIP4SLT1_1102Test TitleSubscribe using an unsupported filter (from producer's point of view): unsupported topicExecution Priority2 (High Priority area)ObjectiveTo subscribe to items using a filter on a producer's unsupported topic (using a TopicExpression).ScenarioTest of faults (TopicNotSupportedFault). The Consumer is interested in receiving regular updates of the Current Situation on an unsupported topic in an asynchronous way (i.e. without polling the Producer).EnvironmentInternet or Co-located. Exchange Pattern: P/S.Participation2 MTRSN/APre-test ConditionsMIP4SLT1_1211,  MIP4SLT1_1213, MIP4SLT1_1215

Prior to initiating exchange of MIP4.0 messages, each participant in the exchange will complete the MIP4.0 Joining Questionnaire [REF-MIP-5] and share this questionnaire with their exchange partners.  The exchange of completed questionnaires will:
? Inform exchange partners of the capabilities of a partner system
? Allow  partners to exchange source identifiers
? Aid in the early identification of potential issues
The exchange partners are expected to resolve any identified issues prior to the actual exchange of MIP4.0 messages.


IDRuleExigence-1Prior to initiating MIP4.0 Information Exchange, the exchange partners shall complete and share the MIP4.0 Joining Questionnaire.[REF-MIP-5]
Both Consumer and Producer systems conform to MIP4.0 Publish/Subscribe Exchange Pattern Specification.

Both Consumer and Producer are able to process and exchange information represented according to MIP4.0 Information Schemas.

Consumer successfully discovered the target Producer.  The system on the Consumer side has been properly configured and is ready to interact with the Producer system.
Test InputsName of single topic to be testedConclusionThe test is concluded after the Consumer is ready to receive regular asynchronous updates of the current situation from the Producer and the Consumer system is able to correctly receive all information associated with the topic, i.e. that it is unsupported by the Producer, over a publish-subscribe exchange.Test OutputsVerification that the information associated with the single topic requested is received correctly.TraceabilityMIP4_Publish_Subscribe_Exchange_Pattern, REQ_EM_0008, REQ_EM_0010, REQ_SYS_0021.

Test Procedure

StepActionExpected ResultSrcDst1. The Consumer subscribes to the Producer in order to advertise its interest in a single topic.  
rpw:GetResourceProperty
with parameters wsn:SimpleTopicExpression,  wsn:FixedTopicSet, wsn:TopicExpressionDialect and wstop:TopicSet. ~~The Producer receives a valid request for resource properties using SimpleTopicExpression ~~122. Producer informs that the subscription topic is unsupported. ~~Consumer receives and interprets requested information correctly. ~~21
Configuration
ItemValueCommentEventGeneration10 --> Combine steps to one event in the MTMT, generate new MTMT events on every source - destination change.
1 --> Every step will be added to the MTMT as a separate event.
