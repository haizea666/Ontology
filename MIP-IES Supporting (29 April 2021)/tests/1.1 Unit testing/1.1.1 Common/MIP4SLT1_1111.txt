Test IDMIP4SLT1_1111Test TitleRetrieve Topic Expression dialects from Producer / ProviderExecution Priority1ObjectiveThe objective is for the Consumer to retrieve the list of Topic Expression Dialects supported by the ProducerScenarioThe Consumer is interested in checking the list of Topic Expression Dialects supported by the Producer to use them for Request/Response and/or Publish/Subscribe exchangesEnvironmentInternet or Co-located. Exchange Pattern: P/S and R/R.Participation2 MTRSN/APre-test ConditionsMIP4SLT1_1211,  MIP4SLT1_1213, MIP4SLT1_1215

Prior to initiating exchange to request resource properties, each participant in the exchange will complete the MIP4.0 Joining Questionnaire [REF-MIP-5] and share this questionnaire with their exchange partners.  The exchange of completed questionnaires will:
? Inform exchange partners of the capabilities of a partner system
? Allow  partners to exchange source identifiers
? Aid in the early identification of potential issues
The exchange partners are expected to resolve any identified issues prior to the actual exchange of MIP4.0 messages.


IDRuleExigence-1Prior to initiating MIP4.0 Information Exchange, the exchange partners shall complete and share the MIP4.0 Joining Questionnaire.[REF-MIP-5]
Both Consumer and Producer systems conform to either MIP4.0 Publish/Subscribe Exchange Pattern Specification or MIP4.0 Request/Response Exchange Pattern Specification or both.
Test InputsN/A.ConclusionThe test is concluded after the Consumer has received a list of Topic Expression Dialects. The list should contain at least the mandatory Dialects defined by EMT and TIDE specification.Test OutputsN/A.TraceabilityREQ_EM_0011.

Test Procedure

StepActionExpected ResultSrcDst1. The consumer sends a request for the list of dialect to the GetResourceProperty service of the producer. Requested property is :
<rp:GetResourceProperty>
b2:TopicExpressionDialect
</rp:GetResourceProperty> ~~The Producer receives a valid request for resource properties using b2:TopicExpressionDialect ~~
122. Producer sends the topic dialects it supports ~~Consumer receives the requested list of topic dialects. ~~213. The list of supported dialects should contain at least the following dialects :
* http://docs.oasis-open.org/wsn/t-1/TopicExpression/Simple
* http://docs.oasis-open.org/wsn/t-1/TopicExpression/Concrete
* http://docs.oasis-open.org/wsn/t-1/TopicExpression/Full ~~~~12
