Test IDMIP4SLT1_1113.Test TitleRetrieve the fixed topic set property from producer / providerExecution Priority1ObjectiveThe objective is for the Consumer to retrieve if the producer topic set is immutableScenarioThe Consumer is interested in checking the immutability of the producer topic before or during using this topic set for Request/Response and/or Publish/Subscribe exchangesEnvironmentInternet or Co-located. Exchange Pattern: P/S and R/R.Participation2 MTRSN/APre-test ConditionsMIP4SLT1_1211,  MIP4SLT1_1213, MIP4SLT1_1215

Prior to initiating exchange to request resource properties, each participant in the exchange will complete the MIP4.0 Joining Questionnaire [REF-MIP-5] and share this questionnaire with their exchange partners.  The exchange of completed questionnaires will:
? Inform exchange partners of the capabilities of a partner system
? Allow  partners to exchange source identifiers
? Aid in the early identification of potential issues
The exchange partners are expected to resolve any identified issues prior to the actual exchange of MIP4.0 messages.


IDRuleExigence-1Prior to initiating MIP4.0 Information Exchange, the exchange partners shall complete and share the MIP4.0 Joining Questionnaire.[REF-MIP-5]
Both Consumer and Producer systems conform to either MIP4.0 Publish/Subscribe Exchange Pattern Specification or MIP4.0 Request/Response Exchange Pattern Specification or both.
Test InputsN/A.ConclusionThe test is concluded after the Consumer has received a Boolean if the Producer Topic Set is immutable or not.Test OutputsN/A.TraceabilityREQ_EM_0011.

Test Procedure

StepActionExpected ResultSrcDst1. The consumer sends a request to check if the Topic Set is Immutable to the GetResourceProperty service of the producer. Requested property is :
<rp:GetResourceProperty>
b2: FixedTopicSet
</rp:GetResourceProperty> ~~The Producer receives a valid request for resource properties using b2:FixedTopicSet ~~
122. Producer sends whether its Topic Set is Immutable or not the topic dialects it supports ~~Consumer receives the FixedTopicSet value as a Boolean. ~~21
