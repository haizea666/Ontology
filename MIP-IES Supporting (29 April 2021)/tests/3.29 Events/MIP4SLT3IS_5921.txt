Test description

Test IDMIP4SLT3IS_5921Test TitleUpdate IED discovery IEDEvent GeometricDefinition.Execution Priority1ObjectiveBSO validation. Test whether the Producer/Provider is able to create and update the geometry information of an IED discovery IEDEvent and the Consumers/Receivers are able to understand (and display) it correctly.ScenarioThe Producer creates an IED discovery IEDEvent with GeometricDefinition Sub-Type = Circle.
The Consumers receive the information and interpret it correctly.
The Producer updates the geometry information of this IEDEvent and the Sub-Type itself to Sphere.
The Consumers receive the information and interpret it correctly.EnvironmentInternet or Co-located. Exchange Pattern: R/R, P/S.Participation2 or more.MTRSApplicablePre-test ConditionsThe Producer/Provider has created a topic which includes message elements belonging to the Event message schema area.
The Consumers have subscribed to this topic.Test InputsN/A.ConclusionThis test is considered a success if the IEDEvent and its geometry information is processed and interpreted correctly on all Nations' C2IS.Test OutputsN/A.TraceabilityREQ_INF_0002

Test Procedure

StepActionExpected ResultSrcDst1. The Producer (1) creates an IEDEvent with name XXX_IEDG_921 and with the following geometry information:
* IncidentCode = 'IEDDiscovery'
* GeometricDefinition Sub-Type = Circle (with at least its Centre and Radius Elements specified)

Notices:
XXX in name of the object is meant (in principle) to be replaced by the 3 letter code of the country name.
Example for the name of the IEDEvent: GBR_ IEDG_921. ~~
Consumers (2) receive and display the IEDEvent correctly. ~~122. The Producer (1) updates the IEDEvent with the following geometry information:
* GeometricDefinition Sub-Type = Sphere (Centre and Radius Elements are also updated) ~~
Consumers (2) receive and display the IEDEvent correctly. ~~12
Configuration
ItemValueCommentIEDEventGeneration10 --> Combine steps to one IEDEvent in the MTMT, generate new MTMT IEDEvents on every source - destination change.
1 --> Every step will be added to the MTMT as a separate IEDEvent.
