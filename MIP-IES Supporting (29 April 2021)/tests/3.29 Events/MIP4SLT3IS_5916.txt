Test Procedure

StepActionExpected ResultSrcDst1. The Producer (1) creates an IEDEvent with name XXX_IEDT_916 and with the following tactical characterization information:
* IncidentCode = 'IEDDiscovery'
* ObservationDateTime.
* GeometricDefinition
* Tactical Characterization:
o UseSequenceCode = 'Secondary'
o IsSuicideIndicator = 'false'
o EmplacementCode = 'Subsurface'
o IsPlacedUnderVehicleIndicator = 'false'
o EmploymentMethodCode = 'Underbelly'

Example for the name of the IEDEvent: ITA_ IEDT_916. ~~
Consumers (2) receive and display the IEDEvent correctly. ~~122. The Producer (1) updates the IEDEvent with the following tactical characterization information:
* UseSequenceCode = 'Primary'
* IsSuicideIndicator = 'true'
* EmplacementCode = 'InOrOn'
* IsPlacedUnderVehicleIndicator = 'true'
* EmploymentMethodCode = 'VehicleBorne' ~~
Consumers (2) receive and display the IEDEvent correctly. ~~12
