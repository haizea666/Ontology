Test IDMIP4SLT3IS_6307Test TitleOrganisations and Units multiple GeometricDefinition updates.Execution Priority1ObjectiveBSO validation. Test whether the Producer/Provider is able to update the GeometricDefinition for a created Unit multiple times and the Consumers/Receivers are able to understand (and display) it correctly.ScenarioThe Producer creates a Unit with a GeometricDefinition.
The Consumers receive the information and interpret it correctly.
The Producer updates multiple times the GeometricDefinition for the Unit.
The Consumers receive the information and interpret it correctly.EnvironmentInternet or Co-located. Exchange Pattern: R/R, P/S.Participation2 or more.MTRSApplicablePre-test ConditionsThe Producer/Provider has created a topic which includes message elements belonging to the Organisations and Units message schema areas.
The Consumers have subscribed to this topic.Test InputsN/A.ConclusionThis test is considered a success if the GeometricDefinition updates are processed and interpreted correctly on all Nations' C2IS.Test OutputsN/A.TraceabilityREQ_INF_0002, REQ_INF_0003.
