Test description

Test IDMIP4SLT3IS_5006Test TitleCreate Unit with GeometricDefinition.Execution Priority1ObjectiveBSO validation. Test whether the Producer/Provider is able to create the correct MIP data for all the operational elements (defined by IDT Schema Documentation > Unit.xsd > Unit) and the Consumers are able to correctly understand (and display) it. Focused on the Unit's GeometricDefinition element.ScenarioThe Producer creates message elements for Unit with at least GeometricDefinition and all its mandatory Elements. The Consumers receive the data and process them.EnvironmentInternet or Co-located. Exchange Pattern: R/R, P/S.Participation2 or more.MTRSN/APre-test ConditionsThe Producer/Provider has created the 'Ground Picture > Forces' topic. The Consumers have subscribed to this topic.Test InputsN/A.ConclusionThis test is considered a success if the unit is created and all elements are processed and interpreted correctly on all Nations' C2IS.Test OutputsN/A.TraceabilityREQ_INF_0002.

Test Procedure

StepActionExpected ResultSrcDst1. The Producer creates the unit with name XXX_UG_015 and fills ALL its mandatory elements with values, especially its GeometricDefinition.

Notices:
XXX in name of the object is meant (in principle) to be replaced by the 3 letter code of the country name.
Example for the name of the unit: ITA_UG_015 ~~
Consumers receive and process (and display) the Unit created and all elements that the Producer created. ~~


122. The Producer creates an update for the object by changing its GeometricDefinition element, keeping the values of the rest elements. ~~Consumers receive and process (and display) the created Unit with GeometricDefinition and all elements that the Producer created. ~~
123. Repeat step 2 until all the LocationType Sub-Types (ArcType, ArrowType, CircleType, CorridorType, EllipseType, FanType, LineType, MultiPointType, OrbitType, PointType, PolygonType, RectangleType, SphereType) are tested. ~~Consumers receive and process (and display) the created Unit with Geographic Location and all elements that the Producer created. ~~
