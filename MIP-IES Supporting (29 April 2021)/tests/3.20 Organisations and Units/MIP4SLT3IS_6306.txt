Test IDMIP4SLT3IS_6306Test TitleOrganisation and Unit GeometricDefinition update (move).Execution Priority1ObjectiveBSO validation. Verify the ability to update and exchange GeometricDefinition information of an Organisation and a Unit in a nation's C2IS.ScenarioNation A creates an Organisation and a Unit, each with a specific GeometricDefinition. 
Nation B receives the information and interprets it correctly.
Nation A updates the GeometricDefinition of both objects (moving them).
Nation B receives the information and interprets it correctly.EnvironmentInternet or Co-located. Exchange Pattern: R/R, P/S.Participation2.MTRSApplicable.Pre-test ConditionsNation A has created a Topic which includes message elements belonging in the Organisation and Unit message schema areas. 
Nation B has subscribed to this Topic.Test InputsN/A.ConclusionThis test is considered a success if the updated GeometricDefinition information of both objects is displayed correctly on both Nations' C2IS.Test OutputsN/A.TraceabilityREQ_INF_0002, REQ_INF_0003.

Test Procedure

StepActionExpected ResultSrcDst1. Nation A creates a message element for an example Organisation and an example Unit, each with a specific GeometricDefinition. ~~Nation B receives and displays both objects correctly. ~~122. Nation A updates the GeometricDefinition for the Organisation and the Unit.
