Test description

Test IDMIP4SLT3IS_5048Test TitleUnits with Orientation based GeometricDefinition.Execution Priority1ObjectiveBSO validation. Test whether the Producer/Provider is able to create the correct MIP data for all the operational elements (defined by IDT Schema Documentation > Unit.xsd > ScoutUnit, as an example unit with its orientation) and the Consumers are able to correctly understand (and display) it.ScenarioThe Producer creates message elements for Orientation based GeometricDefinition. The Consumers receive the data and process them.EnvironmentInternet or Co-located. Exchange Pattern: R/R, P/S.Participation2 or more.MTRSN/APre-test ConditionsThe Producer/Provider has created the 'Ground Picture > Forces' topic. The Consumers have subscribed to this topic.Test InputsN/A.ConclusionThe orientation of the objects is correct when the information is exchanged between the C2IS's of both nations.
This test is considered a success if the unit is created and all elements are processed and interpreted correctly on all Nations' C2IS.Test OutputsN/A.TraceabilityREQ_INF_0002.

Test Procedure

StepActionExpected ResultSrcDst1. The Producer creates an example Unit with known values for its orientation based GeometricDefinition elements (Course, Lat, Lon and Speed), with name XXX_SU_048 and fills at least ALL its mandatory elements.
In particular Nation A creates a Unit with a Course element valorised.

Notices:
XXX in name of the object is meant (in principle) to be replaced by the 3 letter code of the country name.
Example for the name of the Organisation: ITA_SU_048 ~~
Consumers receive and process (and display) the example Unit and all elements that the Producer created.
All elements covering the orientation have been changed correctly. ~~
122. The Producer creates an update for the object by changing its GeometricDefinition and its Sub-Type in particular Point > PointPosition:
* Lon
* Lat
* Course
* Speed ~~
Consumers receive and process (and display) the changed Orientation based GeometricDefinition and all elements that the Producer created.
All elements covering the orientation have been changed correctly. ~~
