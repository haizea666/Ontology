Test IDMIP4SLT3SF_3116Test TitleFilter by Source.Execution Priority1ObjectiveEvaluate the behaviour associated with Filtering, for the Filter by Source type. Commonly defined filtering specifications (Xpath expressions) for both P/S and R/R are recommended.ScenarioA Consumer is subscribed to part of the possible sources on the Producer. Several BSOs both within and out of this subscription will be published at the Producer.EnvironmentInternet, co-located. Exchange Pattern: P/S, R/R.Participation2MTRSPre-test Conditions3.7 Information Scope (Topics)Test InputsN/AConclusionEven though the Consumer may specify a Filter, it remains the responsibility of the Provider to determine how best to satisfy the request.  This may mean that the Consumer receives data outside the parameters of the Filter.  Satisfying the Filter requests of the Consumer should be considered 'best effort' and not a hard requirement.
Consequently, the conclusion of this test is just to evaluate the behaviour associated with Filtering.Test OutputsN/ATraceabilityREQ_SYS_0020, REQ_SYS_0021



Test Procedure

StepActionExpected ResultSrcDst1. The Producer inserts BSOs in its C2IS, both with attributes 'source' belonging and not belonging to the list of sources to which the Consumer has subscribed. ~~It remains the responsibility of the Provider to determine how best to satisfy the Consumer's Filter specification request, which will be considered a 'best effort' requirement.
The not filtered out insertions are automatically received at the Consumer, which is able to incorporate (or not) them to the current operational picture shown on its C2IS.
The Filtering behaviour will be evaluated on both Producer and Consumer sides. ~~122. Producer and Consumer rotate roles and conduct Step 1 again. ~~As steps 1. ~~21
