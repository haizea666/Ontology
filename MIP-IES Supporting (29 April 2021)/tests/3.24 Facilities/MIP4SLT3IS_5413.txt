Test IDMIP4SLT3IS_5413Test TitleUpdate to every possible GeometricDefinition for a Facility.Execution Priority1ObjectiveBSO validation. Verify the ability to create and update every possible GeometricDefinition for a Facility in a nation's C2IS.ScenarioNation A creates a Facility (for instance just a 'Facility' Message Element) with LocationType = PolygonType. 
Nation B receives the information and interprets it correctly.
Nation A updates the Facility to LocationType = ArcType.
Nation B receives the information and interprets it correctly.
Nation A continues to update the Facility to all possible LocationTypes and Nation B receives the information and interprets it every time correctly.EnvironmentInternet or Co-located. Exchange Pattern: R/R, P/S.Participation2MTRSApplicablePre-test ConditionsNation A has created a Topic which includes message elements belonging to the Facility message schema area. 
Nation B has subscribed to this Topic.Test InputsN/A.ConclusionThis test is considered a success if the Facility is displayed correctly on both Nations' C2IS.Test OutputsN/A.TraceabilityREQ_INF_0002, REQ_INF_0003
