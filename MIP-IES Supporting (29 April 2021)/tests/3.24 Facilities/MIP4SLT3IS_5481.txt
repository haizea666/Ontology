Test Procedure

StepActionExpected ResultSrcDst1. The Producer (A) creates a Camp (Facility) with name XXX_CAMP_5481 and with undefined GeometricDefinition

Notices:
XXX in name of the object is meant (in principle) to be replaced by the 3 letter code of the country name.
Example for the name of the Organisation: ITA_ CAMP_5481 ~~Consumers (B) receive and display the Camp correctly (not on the map). ~~122. The Producer (A) updates the Camp with GeometricDefinition=Polygon. ~~Consumers (B) receive and display the Camp correctly (also on the map). ~~123. The Producer (A) updates the Camp again with an undefined GeometricDefinition. ~~Consumers (B) receive and display the Camp correctly (again not on the map). ~~12
