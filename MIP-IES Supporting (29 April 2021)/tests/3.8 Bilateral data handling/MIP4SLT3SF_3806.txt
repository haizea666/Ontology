Test description

Test IDMIP4SLT3SF_3806Test TitleHandling of unsupported object in the C2IS.Execution Priority1ObjectiveTo verify that the National MIP solution can display some information or a generic symbol to users if it receives an unsupported object.ScenarioNation A creates some BSOs in its C2IS that are not supported by Nation B's C2IS. Nation B receives the unsupported objects. Its C2IS displays some information or generic symbol for the objects.EnvironmentCo-located. Exchange Pattern: P/SParticipation2MTRSPre-test ConditionsNation A has published a topic. Nation B has subscribed to Nation A's topic.Test InputsN/AConclusionThe test is passed if Nation B receives the unsupported objects and displays some information or a generic symbol.Test OutputsN/ATraceabilityREQ_SYS_0010



Test Procedure

StepActionExpected ResultSrcDst1. Nation A creates objects that are not supported by a symbol in Nation B's C2IS.

Comments
The desired behaviour of a receiving system encountering an object for which it has no mapped message element is to display the object using a generic symbol.
In order to know which objects Nation B does not support (this objects also have to be ones which nation A itself supports in order for them to be created), the results of each nation from the SLT3IS symbology related tests can be cross-checked. ~~Nation B's C2IS displays some information or a generic symbol for the objects created by nation A. ~~12
